# InstaVerticalViewPager

This project uses Instagram APIs to fecth images with #ifoundawesome and show in Vertical View Pager
with depth(toss) transition.

Libraries Used:
1)Retrofit 
2)Picasso
3)Gson

Task Done:

i) Integrating Instagram API to android App, I have inflated instragram login page as web view on Dialog.
ii) Implemented VerticalViewPager with depth animation.
iii) I have downloaded 20 images at one go and after that i have shown progress dialog to donwload the next bacth of the images.

This is basic app which doesnot maintain login session, each time user have to login again to go back into the application.
To check this app, you can use following credentials
Username:30khiladi30
pswd:qwerty1234
as we need to add users to sandbox app to access Instagram APIs
